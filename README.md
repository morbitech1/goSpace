# goSpace

## Synopsis
goSpace, a pSpace implementation in Go.

## Importing goSpace
To get goSpace, do:

```terminal
go get -u github.com/pspaces/gospace
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pspaces/gospace
git checkout aggregation-policy
```
To import goSpace into your project, add:

```go
import (
      . "github.com/pspaces/gospace"
)
```

## Library

### Usage
A space can be created by using `NewSpace` for creating a local space, or `NewRemoteSpace` for connecting to a remote space.

To create a space on the localhost, one can do:
```go
spc := NewSpace("space")
```

To connect to a remote space with name `space`, one can do:
```go
spc := NewRemoteSpace("tcp://example.com/space")
```

An operation acts on a `Space` structure and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are terms or fields in a tuple or template.

Certain operations require inclusion of a user defined function `f` which operate on a `Tuple` structure.

Operations such as `Put`, `Get`, and so forth are blocking operations.

Operations postfixed by a `P` such as `PutP`, `GetP`, and so forth are non-blocking operations.

For `Put` and `PutP` operations, the terms are values and for the remaining operations terms are either values or binding variables.

Pattern matching can be achieved by passing a binding variable, that is, passing a pointer to a variabe by adding an `&` infront of the variable.

Binding variables can only be passed to `Get*` and `Query*` operations.

### Space Library
goSpace follows the Space Library Specification. It contains the following operations:
```go
Put(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
PutP(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
Get(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
GetP(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
GetAll(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
Query(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
QueryP(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
QueryAll(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
```
Do note that `GetAll` and `QueryAll` are non-blocking operators. Blocking operators may come later.

### Star Library
goSpace has experimental operators for aggregating tuples in a space. It contains the following operations:
```go
PutAgg(f, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
GetAgg(f, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
QueryAgg(f, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
```
Do note that these operators are non-blocking. Blocking operators may come later.

## Space Library Specification
The specification for the pSpace Space Library can be found [here](https://github.com/pspaces/Programming-with-Spaces/blob/master/guide.md).

## Limitations
There are currently some limitations to the implementation:
 - Only TCP over IPv4 is supported.
 - Gates and space repositories are not supported yet.
 - Multiplexing of multiple spaces over a single gate is not supported yet.

## Examples
Examples and cases for goSpace can be found [here](https://github.com/pspaces/gospace-examples).
